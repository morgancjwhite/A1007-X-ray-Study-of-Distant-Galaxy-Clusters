# A1007-X-ray-Study-of-Distant-Galaxy-Clusters

This was my final year MSCI physics research project at the University of Bristol


The aim was to determine limits on the value of the Hubble Constant through measuring distances to a sample of distant galaxy clusters.
The angular diameter distance to each galaxy cluster was measured through combining X-ray and Sunyaevâ€“Zeldovich measurements. An in-depth statistical analysis of the results is given.

Hope you find it interesting!
